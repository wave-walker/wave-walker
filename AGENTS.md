# Agent Guidelines

The role of this file is to describe common mistakes and confusion
points that agents might encounter as they work in this project.
If you ever encounter something in the project that surprises you,
please alert the developer working with you and indicate that this
is the AgentMD file to help prevent future agents from having the 
same issue.

## Notes for Agents

- Keep changes minimal and scoped to the task
- If tests are requested, run the smallest relevant scope
- Use `bin/rails` scripts (not `bundle exec rails`) when possible
